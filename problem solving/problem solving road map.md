#### 💡 Tips & Tricks:

```python
# DP Template العام:
# 1. Define state: dp[i] يعني إيه؟
# 2. Find recurrence relation: dp[i] = f(dp[i-1], dp[i-2], ...)
# 3. Initialize base cases
# 4. Fill the dp array

# مثال: Fibonacci
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0], dp[1] = 0, 1
    
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    
    return dp[n]

# Kadane's Algorithm (Maximum Subarray):
def max_subarray(nums):
    max_sum = current_sum = nums[0]
    
    for num in nums[1:]:
        current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    
    return max_sum

# 0/1 Knapsack Pattern:
def knapsack(weights, values, capacity):
    n = len(weights)
    dp = [[0] * (capacity + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for w in range(1, capacity + 1):
            if weights[i-1] <= w:
                dp[i][w] = max(
                    dp[i-1][w],  # don't take item
                    dp[i-1][w - weights[i-1]] + values[i-1]  # take item
                )
            else:
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w]
    
    return dp[n][capacity]

# Space Optimization (1D DP):
def climb_stairs(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    
    prev2, prev1 = 1, 2
    
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        current = prev1 + prev2
        prev2, prev1 = prev1, current
    
    return prev1
```

#### 💡 Binary Search Tips:

```python
# Binary Search Template (Classical):
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # avoid overflow
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
```

return -1

# Binary Search للـ leftmost position:

def find_first(arr, target): left, right = 0, len(arr)

```
while left < right:
    mid = left + (right - left) // 2
    
    if arr[mid] < target:
        left = mid + 1
    else:
        right = mid

return left
```

# Binary Search على الـ answer (معندكش array):

def binary_search_answer(predicate, lo, hi): """ Find the smallest x where predicate(x) is True """ while lo < hi: mid = lo + (hi - lo) // 2

```
    if predicate(mid):
        hi = mid
    else:
        lo = mid + 1

return lo
```

# Heap (Priority Queue) in Python:
import heapq

# Min Heap (default):
min_heap = []
heapq.heappush(min_heap, 5)
heapq.heappush(min_heap, 3)
smallest = heapq.heappop(min_heap)  # 3

# Max Heap (negate values):
max_heap = []
heapq.heappush(max_heap, -5)
heapq.heappush(max_heap, -3)
largest = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)  # 5

# Heapify existing list:
arr = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]
heapq.heapify(arr)  # O(n)

# K largest elements:
k_largest = heapq.nlargest(k, arr)

# Trie Implementation:
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.is_end = False

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()
    
    def insert(self, word):

## 📚 الموارد الإضافية والنصائح

### 🔥 نصائح عامة للنجاح:

**1. اللي يخليك تنجح:**

- اتعامل مع Problem Solving زي الـ Gym - **consistency أهم من intensity**
- حل 2-3 مسائل يومياً أفضل من 20 مسألة في يوم واحد كل أسبوع
- لو مسألة وقفت معاك أكتر من 30 دقيقة، **اتفرج على الـ solution**
- **راجع المسائل اللي حلتها** بعد أسبوع - هتنسى الحل وده كويس!

**2. طريقة الحل الصحيحة:**

```
1. اقرأ المسألة 3 مرات (افهم الـ input/output)
2. حل أمثلة على الورق (edge cases)
3. فكر في الـ brute force solution الأول
4. حاول تحسنها (Time/Space complexity)
5. اكتب الكود
6. Test مع الأمثلة
7. Submit
8. اقرأ solutions تانية (هتتعلم patterns جديدة)
```

**3. تجنب الأخطاء دي:**

- ❌ حل المسائل عشوائياً بدون ترتيب
- ❌ الاستسلام بسرعة وانت بتحل
- ❌ عدم مراجعة المسائل القديمة
- ❌ التركيز على Hard problems في الأول
- ❌ عدم كتابة الكود بنفسك (مجرد قراءة الـ solution)

## ✅ Checklist نهاية كل أسبوع:

- [ ] حليت الـ target problems للأسبوع
- [ ] راجعت 5 مسائل قديمة على الأقل
- [ ] فهمت الـ patterns الأساسية للـ topic
- [ ] كتبت ملاحظات عن الـ common pitfalls
- [ ] حاولت أحل مسألة واحدة بدون مساعدة

---

**ملاحظة أخيرة:** الـ roadmap ده طموح جداً (550 مسألة في 6 شهور). لو لقيت نفسك متأخر، **مفيش مشكلة**! الأهم الـ consistency مش السرعة. حتى لو وصلت لـ 300-400 مسألة بجودة عالية، ده أفضل بكتير من 550 مسألة حلتهم بسرعة ونسيتهم.

**بالتوفيق! 🚀**
