# 🎮 Mazer - ITI Client-Side Technology Project - Discussion & Planning

## 👋 Introduction

I'm part of a team of 5 students at ITI (Information Technology Institute) working on our final client-side technology project. We need your help to **discuss, refine, and finalize** our game concept before creating the implementation plan.

**⚠️ Important**: Please **DO NOT jump to creating a plan immediately**. I want to have a **collaborative discussion** first where you:

1. Review our current ideas and requirements
2. Ask clarifying questions about unclear aspects
3. Suggest improvements and alternatives
4. Challenge our assumptions constructively
5. Help us refine the scope to fit our timeline
6. **Only AFTER discussion**, create the final comprehensive plan

## 🎮 Game Concept: "Mazer"

### Core Idea:

A 2D top-down Egyptian pyramid maze game where an archaeologist explores ancient pyramids, discovers that the ancient Pharaohs invented programming, and must escape while solving coding puzzles.

### Story Concept:

"Dr. Zahi, a young Egyptian archaeologist, discovers a secret entrance to a forgotten pyramid in Saqqara. While searching for the legendary 'Gem of Ra,' the entrance collapses behind him. Deep inside, he discovers ancient hieroglyphics that reveal the Pharaohs were the first to invent programming! Now he must escape by understanding their ancient 'code' while racing against time."

---

## 🎯 Game Features (Confirmed)

### Core Mechanics:

1. **Player Movement**: Arrow keys (⬆️⬇️⬅️➡️)
2. **Objective**: Collect keys to unlock the door and escape each level
3. **Health System**: Hearts (❤️❤️❤️) - lose on damage from enemies or wrong answers
4. **Timer**: Each level has a countdown
5. **Scoring**: Points from keys, gems, remaining time, health

### Unique Feature: Code Questions

- **When**: If player reaches door without ALL keys (e.g., has 3/5 keys)
- **What**: Simple JavaScript quiz question appears (15 seconds to answer)
    - Example: "What is the output? `console.log(2 + 2);`"
    - Choices: [2] [4] [22] [NaN]
- **Wrong Answer**: Lose 1 heart ❤️, can retry
- **Right Answer**: Door unlocks (compensates for missing keys)
- **Question Difficulty**: Easy (basic output, simple syntax)

### Story Videos (Veo 3):

- **Intro Video**: Character enters pyramid, discovers secret
- **Between Levels**: Short 10-15 second story progression
    - After Level 1: "Discovered the first ancient code..."
    - After Level 2: "Found the secret of algorithms..."
- **Outro Video**: Character escapes with knowledge
- **Total**: 5 videos (Intro + 3 transitions + Outro)

### Level Structure:

- **3 Levels** (feasible in 8 days)
- **Progressive Difficulty**:
    - Level 1: Simple maze, 1 enemy, 60 seconds
    - Level 2: Medium maze, 2 enemies, 90 seconds
    - Level 3: Complex maze, 3 enemies, 120 seconds

### Enemies:

- **Type**: Mummies (🧟) - one type to keep it simple
- **Behavior**: Move in fixed patrol patterns
- **Collision**: Touch = lose 1 heart ❤️

### Collectibles:

- **Keys** (🔑): 3-5 per level (must collect to unlock door)
- **Health** (❤️): Optional health pickups
- **Gems** (💎): Bonus points (optional)

2. **Enemy (Mummy)**:
    
    - Size: 32×32 pixels per frame
    - Layout: 4 directions × 4 frames = 128×128 image
3. **Items** (animated):
    
    - Keys, Hearts, Gems
    - Size: 32×32 each, 4 animation frames

### Required Tileset:

- **Environment Tiles**:
    - Walls (4 variations with different hieroglyphics)
    - Floors (4 variations: plain, decorated, carpet, cracked)
    - Doors (closed, open, magic portal, golden)

## ❓ Questions for Discussion

Before creating the plan, I need your input on:

### 1. Scope & Feasibility:

- Is 3 levels realistic in 8 days for our skill levels?
- Should we simplify any features? (e.g., only 1 enemy type is fine?)
- Are the story videos essential or "nice-to-have"?


### 2. Technical Decisions:

- Should we use ES6 modules or keep everything in global scope for simplicity?
- Canvas rendering vs. DOM manipulation - is Canvas the right choice?
- How to structure the game loop efficiently?

### 3. Asset Creation:

- Should we generate ALL assets with AI, or mix with free resources?
- What's the best prompt structure for Nanobana to ensure consistency?
- how to train and use the sprites also ? 
- 
- Backup plan if Nanobana doesn't produce usable sprites?

### 4. Team Coordination:

- How to ensure beginners (Menna, Mohanad) contribute meaningfully without blocking progress?
- Should we pair program (advanced + beginner)?
- Daily standup format?

### 5. Responsive Design:

- Should we build "mobile-first" or "desktop-first"?
- Is it okay if mobile experience is "acceptable" rather than "perfect"?

### 6. Testing & QA:

- Who handles cross-browser testing?
- When should we start testing (continuous vs. final phase)?
- how to test also ?

## 🚨 Important Notes

- **Simplicity Over Features**: We prefer a polished 3-level game over a buggy 5-level game
- **Learning vs. Shipping**: We're okay learning new things but need to ship on time
- **Individual Commits**: Every member MUST have commits (requirement)
- **No Frameworks**: Pure HTML/CSS/JS only (school requirement)
- **Uniqueness**: Game must be different from other teams

---

## 💬 Let's Discuss!

Please start by:

1. Telling me your initial thoughts on feasibility
2. Asking any clarifying questions
3. Pointing out potential risks or challenges
4. Suggesting any improvements to the concept

**Remember**: I want a discussion first, NOT a final plan yet. Let's refine this together
