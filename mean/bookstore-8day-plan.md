## 📅 Day 1 — Group Architecture + Individual Setup

### Morning (2 Hours — Everyone Present)
- Person 2 draws the ERD while everyone watches and corrects in real time
- Lock all 7 schemas — **no schema changes allowed after this meeting**
- Write down and agree on all shared contracts
- Write down all route URLs for every module and have everyone confirm them
- Create both GitHub repositories
- Set up branch structure: `main → dev → feature/auth`, `feature/catalog`, `feature/commerce`, `feature/reviews-admin`
- Everyone clones both repos and confirms they run locally before the meeting ends

---

### Afternoon — Person 1
- Initialize Node.js project and install packages: `express`, `mongoose`, `bcryptjs`, `jsonwebtoken`, `joi`, `dotenv`, `cors`, `helmet`
- Create the database connection file (logs success, exits on failure)
- Build `ApiError` — custom error class with status code, message, and optional errors array
- Build `errorHandler` middleware:
  - Handles `ApiError` instances with correct status codes
  - Handles MongoDB duplicate key errors (code 11000) with 409
  - Returns generic 500 for unknown errors
  - Never exposes stack traces in production
- Build `authenticate` middleware — reads Authorization header, verifies JWT, attaches decoded user to `req.user`, throws 401 for missing/expired/invalid token
- Build `authorize` middleware — accepts role names, throws 403 if `req.user.role` not in list
- Set up `app.js` with `helmet`, `cors`, JSON body parser, placeholder router mounts, and `errorHandler` as last middleware
- Create `.env.example` with all required keys. Add `.env` to `.gitignore` immediately
- **Push middleware and utils to dev branch immediately — everyone else pulls before writing any controller**

---

### Afternoon — Person 2
- Build the Category schema (unique name field)
- Build the Book schema (all fields, text index on name, regular index on price, correct references)
- Finalize the ERD — all 7 collections, fields, and labeled relationship arrows
- Export ERD as PNG and add to backend repo root
- Create Angular project with routing and SCSS enabled
- Install Angular Material and choose a theme
- Configure main routing file with lazy-loaded routes: auth, books, cart, orders, admin
- Generate component files for: Home, Book List, Book Detail, BookCard, StarRating

---

### Afternoon — Person 3
- Build the Cart schema (one cart per user, items array with book reference and quantity)
- Build the Order schema (include `priceAtPurchase` field on each item)
- Build `ApiResponse.js` — utility with a static `success` method for consistent response shapes
- Build `pagination.js` — takes model, query, options, page, limit. Runs two parallel queries. Returns data + pagination object with `total`, `page`, `limit`, `totalPages`, `hasNext`, `hasPrev`
- Build `logger.js` using `pino` and `pino-http` with colorized output in dev mode
- Study MongoDB transaction patterns — write notes or pseudocode (you implement this on Day 2)
- Generate module and component files for: Cart, Checkout, Order History, Navbar

---

### Afternoon — Person 4
- Build the Author schema (name and bio)
- Build the Review schema with compound unique index on `user + book`
- Set up Cloudinary config file using three env vars: cloud name, API key, API secret
- Test pre-signed URL generation locally — generate signature + timestamp, upload test image directly to Cloudinary without routing through your server, confirm `secure_url` returned
- Generate Admin module with routing and four components: `manage-books`, `manage-authors`, `manage-categories`, `manage-orders`
- Generate `review-section` component in shared folder
- Set up admin layout with `mat-sidenav` sidebar shell and navigation links

---

## 📅 Day 2 — Backend Routes

### Person 1 — Complete Auth Backend
- Build the User schema
- Build Joi validation schemas:
  - **Register:** valid email, firstName/lastName 2–50 chars, dob must be past date, password min 8 chars with at least one uppercase + lowercase + number
  - **Login:** email and password required
  - **Update Profile:** same optional fields as register, at least one must be present
- Build auth service: hash password (bcrypt 12 rounds), compare password, generate JWT with `_id`, `email`, `role`
- Build **Register** controller: validate → check email unique (409) → hash password → create user → remove password from response → return 201
- Build **Login** controller: validate → find user (401 if not found, never reveal which field) → compare passwords (401 on mismatch) → generate JWT → remove password → return 200 with token and user
- Build **Logout** controller — return 200 only, token removal is the client's responsibility
- Build **Update Profile** controller: authenticate first → validate → find by `req.user._id` → update only provided fields → return updated user without password
- Build routes file and mount router in `app.js`

---

### Person 2 — Category and Book Routes
- Build category validation: `createCategory` requires name 2–100 chars, `updateCategory` same rule
- **Create Category** — validate, create, return 201 (unique index handles duplicates via errorHandler)
- **Get All Categories** — find all sorted alphabetically, return 200
- **Update Category** — validate, find by ID and update, 404 if not found
- **Delete Category** — find (404 if missing) → `Book.updateMany` sets category to null on linked books → delete category → return message explaining linked books are now uncategorized
- Build category routes with `authenticate` + `authorize('admin')` on all write operations
- Build book validation: `createBook` requires all fields including valid URI for `coverImage` and valid ObjectIds. `updateBook` makes all fields optional but requires at least one
- Build book service with function that constructs MongoDB query from filter params (handles text search, category, author, price range)
- **Create Book** — validate → verify author exists (404) → verify category exists if provided (404) → create → return with populated author and category → 201
- **Get All Books** — extract page, limit, filter params → build query → run paginated query and count in parallel → return data and pagination
- **Get Single Book** — find by ID with populated author and category, 404 if not found
- **Update Book** — validate, find and update, 404 if not found, return populated book
- **Delete Book** — find and delete, 404 if not found, return success message
- Build book routes file with auth middleware on admin-only operations

---

### Person 3 — Cart Routes + Start Orders
- Build cart validation: `addToCart` requires valid `bookId` and quantity ≥ 1
- **View Cart** — find cart by user ID → if no cart return empty cart with zero total → populate book fields (name, price, coverImage, stock) → calculate total → return
- **Add to Cart** — validate → find book (404) → check stock sufficient (400) → find or create cart → if book already in cart increase quantity (cap at stock) → if new push to items → save, populate, return
- **Remove from Cart** — find cart, filter out matching bookId, save and return
- Build cart routes with `authenticate` on all three routes
- Build order validation: `placeOrder` requires `shippingDetails` with fullName, address, city, phone. `updateStatus` allows `"out_for_delivery"` or `"delivered"` and paymentStatus `"success"`
- Build the **order transaction service:**
  1. Start MongoDB session + begin transaction
  2. Find user's cart with books populated — abort + 400 if empty
  3. For each cart item: find book (session attached, 404 if missing) → check stock (abort + 400 with book name if insufficient) → reduce stock and save with session → build order item with `priceAtPurchase` snapshot
  4. Create order document with session
  5. Delete cart with session
  6. Commit transaction
  7. Abort and re-throw on any error
  8. Always end session in `finally` block

---

### Person 4 — Author Routes + Review Routes + Upload Route
- Build author validation: `createAuthor` requires name (2–100 chars) and bio (10–1000 chars). `updateAuthor` makes both optional but requires at least one
- **Create Author** — validate, create, return 201
- **Update Author** — validate, find by ID and update, 404 if not found
- **List Authors** — find all sorted alphabetically, return 200
- Build author routes with `authenticate` + `authorize('admin')` on write operations
- Build review validation: `addReview` requires rating 1–5, comment optional max 500 chars
- **Add Review** — validate → check book exists (404) → check user has at least one order with status `"delivered"` containing this bookId (403 if not) → create review → if duplicate key error (compound index) return 409 "You have already reviewed this book" → populate user name → return 201
- **View Reviews** — check book exists → find all reviews for bookId sorted newest first with user name populated → calculate average rating → return reviews, `averageRating` (1 decimal), and count
- **Delete Review** — find (404) → verify `review.user` matches `req.user._id` (403 if not) → delete → return 200
- **Upload** — generate Cloudinary signature using current timestamp + API secret → return signature, timestamp, cloud name, API key, and folder name to client (client uploads directly to Cloudinary)
- Build upload routes with `authenticate` + `authorize('admin')`

---

## 📅 Day 3 — Backend Finishes + Frontend Core Starts

### Person 1 — Switch Fully to Frontend Core
> No more backend work from today. If teammates have auth bugs they read the code themselves first.

- Write **all TypeScript interfaces** in `core/models/`: User, Book, Author, Category, CartItem, Cart, OrderItem, ShippingDetails, Order, Review. Everyone imports from these files — nobody defines their own
- Build **AuthService:**
  - `register()` — POST to register endpoint
  - `login()` — POST to login, on success save token to localStorage
  - `logout()` — remove token from localStorage, navigate to login
  - `getToken()` — read token from localStorage
  - `getCurrentUser()` — decode JWT payload from stored token, return user object (never call the API for this)
  - `isLoggedIn()` — returns whether a token exists
  - `isAdmin()` — checks decoded user's role is `"admin"`
  - `updateProfile()` — PATCH to profile endpoint
- Build **TokenInterceptor** — intercepts every outgoing HTTP request, clones it and adds Authorization header if token exists
- Build **ErrorInterceptor** — intercepts every HTTP response, calls `authService.logout()` on 401, navigates home and shows snackbar on 403
- Build **AuthGuard** — checks `isLoggedIn()`, redirects to login if false
- Build **AdminGuard** — checks `isAdmin()`, redirects to home if false
- Register both interceptors in `app.module.ts` providers
- Build **Login page:** reactive form (email + password) → field-level errors → loading spinner on button → form disabled while loading → navigate to `/books` on success → show server error below form → link to register
- Build **Register page:** reactive form (email, firstName, lastName, dob, password) → navigate to login on success with success snackbar → show server error on failure

---

### Person 2 — Finish Book Routes + Test in Postman
- Finish any remaining book controller logic from Day 2
- Test every catalog route in Postman:
  - Create category as admin → 201
  - Create same category again → 409
  - Get all categories → 200 with array
  - Update category → 200 with updated data
  - Delete category → 200, confirm linked books have null category in DB
  - Create author → 201, update → 200, get all → 200
  - Create book with valid author + category → 201 with populated data
  - Create book with non-existent author ID → 404
  - Search books by name → relevant results
  - Filter by category, author, price range → correct results only
  - Paginate → page 2 returns different books than page 1
  - Get single book → populated author and category shown
  - Update book as admin → changes reflected
  - Delete book as admin → 200
  - Create book as regular user → 403
- Mount all catalog routers in `app.js`

---

### Person 3 — Finish Order Routes + Test Full Flow
- **Place Order** controller — validate body, call transaction service, return 201
- **View My Orders** — find orders by authenticated user → sort newest first → paginate → populate book name and cover → return with pagination
- **Get All Orders (admin)** — find all, support optional status filter from query params → paginate → populate user (firstName, lastName, email) and book name → return with pagination
- **Update Order Status** — validate → find order (404) → enforce transitions: `processing → out_for_delivery` only, `out_for_delivery → delivered` only, `delivered → nowhere` (400 on invalid transition) → update and save → return updated order
- Build routes file — register `/my` route BEFORE `/:id` to prevent Express treating "my" as an ID param
- Mount order and cart routers in `app.js`
- Test full order flow in Postman:
  - Add books to cart → place order → "processing" status created
  - Verify book stock reduced in database
  - Verify cart is empty after order
  - Place order with zero-stock book → 400
  - Test all invalid status transitions → confirm 400

---

### Person 4 — Test All Routes + Start Admin Frontend
- Test every review and upload route in Postman:
  - Add review without login → 401
  - Add review for book never ordered → 403
  - Add review for book with order status "processing" → 403
  - Add review for book with "delivered" order → 201
  - Add second review for same book → 409
  - Get reviews → reviews array, averageRating, count all correct
  - Delete own review → 200
  - Delete another user's review → 403
  - Get pre-signed URL as admin → returns signature, timestamp, cloudName, apiKey, folder
  - Use signature to upload test image → confirm `secure_url` returned
  - Create book using that URL → confirm it works
- Mount author, review, and upload routers in `app.js`
- Build **Admin Panel layout** with `mat-sidenav`:
  - Sidebar with navigation links to Books, Authors, Categories, Orders
  - Main content area with router outlet
  - Placeholder table components for each section so routing works

---

## 📅 Day 4 — Frontend Feature Pages
> Use mock data today. Do not wire to the real API yet — that is Day 5. Focus on getting the UI correct.

### Person 1 — Profile Page + Auth Polish
- Build **Profile page:**
  - On init read current user from `authService.getCurrentUser()` — no API call, just decode token
  - Pre-fill reactive form with firstName, lastName, dob
  - Show email as read-only text (backend doesn't allow changing it)
  - On submit call `authService.updateProfile()`
  - Show success snackbar on success, error message on failure
- Polish Login and Register pages:
  - Every field must have a `mat-error` message
  - Submit button shows spinner and is disabled while request is in progress
  - Form is disabled during loading to prevent editing mid-request

---

  - Books link always visible
  - Not logged in: Login + Register links
  - Logged in: Cart (with item count badge), My Orders, Profile, Logout
  - Admin: also show Admin Panel link
  - `routerLinkActive` on current page
  - Cart count badge subscribes to `cartCount$` from CartService
- Build **CartService:**
  - `BehaviorSubject` starting at 0 emitting current item count
  - `cartCount$` observable for Navbar
  - Method stubs: `getCart()`, `addToCart()`, `removeFromCart()`, `refreshCartCount()`

  - Logged-in, no purchase: "Purchase this book to leave a review"
  - Already reviewed: show own review with delete button, hide form

---

## 📅 Day 5 — Wire Everything to Real API

### Person 1 — Integration Support + Wire Profile
- Wire **Profile page** to real API: decode token on init, pre-fill form, handle success and error on submit
- Spot check every other person's pages with DevTools open:
  - Protected routes include Authorization header in every request
  - Public routes do not include the header
  - 401 response correctly logs out and redirects to login
  - 403 shows appropriate message without crashing
- Wire cart count to Navbar by subscribing to `cartService.cartCount$` via async pipe
- Ensure `refreshCartCount()` is called when user logs in
- After today: Person 1 is no longer responsible for helping with auth issues

---

### Person 2 — Wire Catalog Pages to Real API
- Build **BookService**, **CategoryService**, **AuthorService** with real HttpClient calls:
  - `BookService.getBooks()` accepts a params object and converts to `HttpParams`
  - All other methods are straightforward GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE calls
- Wire **Home page:** on init call `getBooks()` (limit 8) and `getAuthors()`, use real responses
- Wire **Books List page:**
  - On init call `getCategories()` and `getAuthors()` to populate filter sidebar
  - On init call `loadBooks()` for initial list
  - Search uses RxJS Subject with `debounceTime(400ms)` and `distinctUntilChanged()`
  - Filter and page changes all call `loadBooks()` with updated params
  - Show loading state while fetching, error state on failure
- Wire **Book Detail page:**
  - On init read book ID from route params, call `getBook(id)`
  - "Add to Cart" calls `cartService.addToCart()` — redirect to login if not logged in
  - Show success snackbar on add, server error message on failure

---

### Person 3 — Wire Commerce Pages + Finish Deployment
- Wire **Cart page:** on init check login (redirect if not) → call `getCart()` → remove button calls `removeFromCart(bookId)` → show empty state when items is empty
- Wire **Checkout page:** on init call `getCart()` to populate summary panel → Place Order calls `orderService.placeOrder()` with shipping values → on success: snackbar + navigate to `/orders` → on error: show in snackbar + re-enable button → disable button on click, re-enable only on error
- Wire **Order History page:** on init call `getMyOrders()` → show loading state → show empty state if no orders
- **Deploy backend to Railway:**
  1. Push all backend code to GitHub
  2. Create new Railway project connected to backend repository
  3. Add all env vars: `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`, `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`, `PORT`, `NODE_ENV`, `FRONTEND_URL`
  4. Check logs for "MongoDB connected" and "Server running"
  5. Test live URL responds correctly
  6. Share live backend URL with Person 2

---

### Person 4 — Wire Admin Tables + Wire Review Component
- Wire **Manage Books table:** on init call `getBooks()` + load authors/categories for dialog dropdowns → after dialog closes reload books list
- Wire **Book Dialog image upload flow:**
  1. File selected → show preview via FileReader
  2. Call `adminService.getPresignedUrl()` to get signature data
  3. POST file directly to Cloudinary's upload endpoint using signature
  4. Extract `secure_url` and store in form
  5. Show progress bar during upload
  6. On upload failure: show error and allow retry
- Wire Manage Authors and Categories tables the same way as books
- Wire **Manage Orders table:** load on init → status dropdown calls `updateOrderStatus()` and reloads
- Wire **Review Section component:**
  - On init call reviews endpoint for `bookId` and display results
  - If logged in, call `orderService.getMyOrders()` and check if any order has status `"delivered"` and contains this book ID — set `hasPurchased` accordingly
  - Check if user already has a review in the loaded list — set `alreadyReviewed`
  - Submit calls reviews POST endpoint, on success reload reviews
  - Delete calls delete endpoint, reloads on success
- Place `<app-review-section [bookId]="bookId">` inside Person 2's Book Detail page at the bottom

## 📅 Day 7 — Polish + Deployment

### Morning — UI Polish

**Person 1**
- Review every error message — no raw error objects shown to users anywhere
- All errors must be either a `mat-snackbar` message or an inline `mat-error` under a field
- Verify every submit button has a spinner and is disabled during requests
- Add a 404 Not Found page and a wildcard route at the bottom of the routing configuration

**Person 2**
- Make books grid responsive: 4 columns on desktop → 2 on tablet → 1 on mobile
- Ensure all cover images use `object-fit: cover` with a fixed height
- Add loading state while books are fetching

**Person 3**
- Make cart page stack vertically on mobile: items list on top, summary panel below
- Ensure checkout "Place Order" button is disabled immediately on first click and only re-enabled on error
- Make order status badge colors readable on all screen sizes

**Person 4**
- Make admin sidebar collapsible on mobile with hamburger toggle button in toolbar
- All admin tables scroll horizontally on mobile instead of breaking layout

---

### Afternoon — Backend Deployment (Person 3 → Railway)
1. Push all final backend code to GitHub
2. Log in to Railway → create new project connected to backend repository
3. Set all env vars: `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`, `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`, `PORT`, `NODE_ENV`, `FRONTEND_URL`
4. Check logs for "MongoDB connected" and "Server running"
5. Test every route group in Postman against the live URL
6. Confirm CORS is configured to allow the Vercel frontend domain

### Afternoon — Frontend Deployment (Person 2 → Vercel)
1. Update `environment.prod.ts` with the live backend URL from Person 3
2. Confirm `environment.ts` still points to localhost for development
3. Build Angular app for production (`ng build --configuration=production`) and confirm no errors
4. Deploy to Vercel: connect frontend GitHub repo, set correct output directory
5. Test every page on the live Vercel URL and confirm no CORS errors in browser console

- Admin login: save to `{{adminToken}}` separately
- Export as JSON and add to backend repository

**Person 2 — ERD**
- Export finalized ERD as high-resolution PNG
- Add to backend repository root

## 🔄 Daily Sync Rules

- **Every morning — 15-minute standup. Each person answers:**
  1. What did I finish yesterday?
  2. What am I doing today?
  3. Am I blocked by anything?

- If stuck for more than **2 hours** → post in the group chat immediately. Do not lose half a day silently.
- After Day 3: Person 1 is **not** the auth support person — read `authenticate.js` and `authorize.js` yourself first.
- Before merging any branch into `dev`: **at least one other team member must review the code.**
- Any schema change after Day 1 **must be discussed with the whole team first.**
